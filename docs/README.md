# Sokomind Web

The web edition is a responsive, dependency-free browser game ready for GitHub
Pages. It includes five levels from Ultra Tiny through Huge, keyboard play,
undo/reset, a first-move timer, hints, and animated solving in a background Web
Worker.

The browser runtime is split by responsibility without requiring a build tool:
game rules, telemetry formatting, page UI, worker orchestration, solver rules and
heuristics, search algorithms, and the Web Worker protocol each have an explicit
module boundary. Pure rule and formatting modules run directly in Node tests, while
the page and worker load the same files as classic scripts.
`build.json` is the authoritative release identifier. The unversioned bootstrap
fetches it without cache and injects that revision into every stylesheet, UI,
policy, director, engine, search, and worker request. `npm run check:build`
rejects copied versions or missing revision propagation.

The move-history panel records every direction, marks pushes, follows
undo/reset, and can copy the complete numbered sequence for sharing.

The search-log panel records the solver's analysis and decisions separately
from player moves. It includes the derived phase plan, worker configuration,
state budgets, expansion rates, heuristic improvements, frontier sizes,
checkpoints, landmarks, bridge handoffs, completions, errors, and 30-second
worker heartbeats. The complete log can be copied for performance comparisons.
Completion entries include elapsed time and an explicit termination reason plus
generated-state, peak-frontier, compaction, and retained-state telemetry when the
worker supplies it. The on-screen field renders the newest 1,500 entries, while
Copy preserves the complete in-memory log for long-run analysis.
Direct-search completions also report compiled-graph construction, dense-board
index construction, heuristic, robot-reachability, cache-hit, push-generation,
goal-commitment, support-dependency, local-room/corral, typed doorway-flow, heap,
worker startup/wall-clock/termination, and pruning measurements. Unsupported
browser heap APIs are omitted rather than displayed as zero. Robot flood fills
and forward push generation use
immutable integer cell IDs and typed arrays while retaining string coordinates
at module boundaries for compatible logs, checkpoints, and replay paths.
The versioned memory schema reports support, source, used/peak/delta bytes,
sample count, and `gcControlled`. Browser JavaScript cannot require garbage
collection before sampling, so those values are useful regression envelopes
rather than exact retained-object measurements.
Canonical box layouts retain collision-free dense base-36 keys for memo tables
and worker boundaries. Hot search transposition maps instead use collision-free
packed `BigInt` identities that combine sorted typed-box cell tokens with the
exact robot cell or canonical reachable-region ID. Each immutable layout caches
typed cell/label/token arrays, a cell-to-box index, and an occupancy bitset.
Successors copy only those dense containers and update the moved box, its bit
words, and its identity; readable coordinates remain at protocol and diagnostic
boundaries. Search telemetry distinguishes full layout builds from these
copy-on-write derivations.
When the parent's exact Hungarian assignment is cached, the heuristic reuses all
unchanged cost rows and repairs the matching with one O(n-squared) augmenting-path
update instead of rebuilding it in O(n-cubed). Reviewed profiles select groups of
at least three boxes in JavaScript and five in Python; smaller groups keep the
simpler full calculation. The exact update may inspect every row/goal edge while
finding its augmenting path, so O(n) is not generally possible. Randomized and
unreachable-edge tests compare repair against full recomputation, and telemetry
reports repairs, fallbacks, and reused rows.

The selected compatible assignment also drives a dynamic support dependency
graph. It records recursive blocker prerequisites and cycles, concrete vacating
actions, required staging sides, and a minimum displacement count over unique
blocking boxes. Typed doorway analysis turns room imports and exports into
particular-box crossing tasks, orders same-box and shared-corridor transfers,
groups non-conflicting transfers into simultaneous waves, and records gate or
staging restoration obligations. These bounded models guide ordering; they do
not prune a state without a separate exact local contradiction certificate.

Bounded goal rooms can also compile relaxed multi-box pattern tables for groups
of two to four boxes. Shared labels and generic boxes are supported by minimizing
over compatible room-box choices plus the remaining outside assignment. Rooms
with more than four goals are split into label-disjoint partitions without
splitting one shared-label group. Tables stop after 12,000 states and compatible
selection after 512 combinations; either cutoff retains the ordinary assignment
bound.

Unique-label box pairs whose shortest push corridors overlap a tunnel or
articulation receive a second bounded check. Boards with at most three boxes and
32 floor cells also compile an exact relaxed capacity table for shared, generic,
gate, staging, and support conflicts. The same proven subset runs in Python.
Room, pair, and capacity improvements enter one
label-disjoint selection—an exact maximum for up to 20 involved labels—preventing
a box's unavoidable detour from being counted twice. Cutoffs and shared-label
assignments retain the Hungarian bound.

Exact Push A* also recognizes a conservative goal-cut certificate. A non-goal
articulation must be statically dead for every box label, and every resulting
active component must contain exactly its own compatible boxes and goals. The
solver then solves each component independently, restricts pushes to that
component, stitches the paths, and replay-validates the global result. Near
misses fall back to ordinary search unchanged.

Ultimate Bidirectional's planning worker also returns a clone-safe prepared-board
seed. Subsequent portfolio workers reuse its immutable geometry, topology,
typed-goal reverse-distance tables, seeded player-aware push distances, dense
indices, compiled single-box graph, and goal-room packing tables while
creating private heuristic, deadlock, and signature caches. Workers verify the
exact board contents and schema before reuse and rebuild normally on a mismatch.
Compiled room-pattern, pair-conflict, and small capacity tables are included in
that seed so
portfolio workers do not repeat their bounded reverse enumeration.
This uses standard structured cloning because shared memory requires
cross-origin isolation headers that GitHub Pages does not reliably provide.
The reviewed Huge profile estimates a 106,838-byte seed and measured median
55.463 ms construction, 2.377 ms cloning, and 19.354 ms hydration under Node
24.14.0; browser lifecycle telemetry remains the authoritative deployment view.
The adjacent `{ }` control copies the complete run as newline-delimited JSON.
Each event includes a schema version, run ID, sequence number, timestamp, elapsed
milliseconds, solver build, level, category, message, and typed statistics.

The default solver is **Ultimate Bidirectional**, an experimental Sokoban-aware
search. It starts one forward Web Worker from the current board and one or more
reverse Web Workers from different solved robot regions. The reverse workers
"unsolve" the puzzle with legal reverse pulls; when the forward search and any
reverse search reach the same canonical box layout and robot-reachability
region, the browser stitches both halves into a playable solution.

Before launching that portfolio, a planning worker reads the puzzle and returns
a serializable analysis report. It measures initial push branching and assignment
distance; detects articulation gates, tunnels, gated goal rooms, packing
dependencies, and surplus room boxes; assigns a difficulty band; and recommends
worker counts, beam widths, state budgets, macros, and ordered strategic phases.
The browser director builds the portfolio from this report and records the
rationale in the search log.

The regular **Ultimate Search** mode is still available. It uses a multi-worker
portfolio that races complementary strategies such as Push Greedy, Weighted Push
A*, and Push A*. All advanced workers use push-level search, dead-square
pruning, robot-reachability canonicalization, and wall-aware push-distance
heuristics. This is much more appropriate for large Sokoban boards than
expanding every single walking step.

Ultimate modes also race a bounded-memory Push Beam strategy. It uses exact
box-to-goal assignment for all box counts, player-side-aware push pattern maps,
automatic room and chokepoint analysis, constrained-goal packing, robot-region
mobility, and deterministic diversity while retaining only a fixed-width push
frontier. Separate beam quotas preserve promising direct states and strategic
temporary detours. Search priorities count pushes; walking paths are preserved
for replay but do not distract the solver from strategic progress.

Each oversized beam layer also reserves a profile-dependent feature archive.
Coarse joint cells distinguish heuristic slack, room and evacuation pressure,
packing progress, doorway state, support dependencies, local-room guidance, and
robot mobility. Candidates are drawn round-robin from those cells before the
remaining slots use the established heuristic bands and push-class diversity.
This keeps strategically different states alive even when their scalar scores are
worse. The archive is bounded by the existing beam width and can be disabled for
diagnostic comparisons; exact searches are unchanged.

On very large boards, direct search uses a sequential memory-bounded restart
portfolio instead of retaining one ever-growing frontier. Restarts alternate
focused, detour, and room-milestone profiles with independent deterministic
seeds. The milestone beam reserves capacity for distinct opening push sequences
and room-crossing histories, including moves that temporarily worsen the raw
box-to-goal estimate.
Completed games save their best push count as an incumbent upper bound; later
searches prune states whose push lower bound already exceeds that solution.
After the beam attempts, complex boards run fresh-worker limited-discrepancy
depth-first searches. Early contours explore only the top-ranked continuation;
later contours admit progressively less obvious choices. This prevents every
restart from exhausting its budget below one attractive branch while retaining
a compact transposition table. A memory-light push IDA* engine is also available
for admissible push-bound contours.

Very large boards also use box-run macros. A local search follows several legal
pushes of one box, including turns, and returns only diverse stopping points to
the global beam. This lets the solver evaluate temporary setup sequences as one
strategic action. Low-distance macro states are handed to several bounded
endgame searches with different packing priorities.
Incomplete macro workers receive a limited push allowance above a known
incumbent, making it possible to discover an easier non-optimal solution before
the exact workers prove or improve the incumbent.

When topology analysis finds a one-entrance room containing more boxes of a
label than the room can ultimately accept, a dedicated evacuation worker treats
moving the surplus through the gate as its first subgoal. After the surplus is
clear, the ordinary assignment and packing scores take over. This objective is
derived from room contents and goals, without puzzle-specific moves or coordinates.

Incomplete forward workers publish replayable box-layout checkpoints. A phase
checkpoint starts a milestone-conditioned reverse worker from the solved layouts;
it discards reverse states that no box assignment can reach from that checkpoint.
The reverse worker publishes stratified landmarks, and bounded bridge workers try
to join compatible checkpoint/landmark pairs. A successful bridge is stitched to
the forward prefix and reverse suffix and replay-validated before it is accepted.
All milestones, targets, and worker assignments are derived from the loaded board.
Milestone landmark generations supersede queued opening bridges instead of sharing
a lifetime quota with them. Bridge candidates are ranked globally, and incompatible
targets do not consume a campaign's viable-search quota. New packing checkpoints
start fresh campaigns. Promising incomplete bridges publish replayable checkpoints
for up to two bounded continuations. Continuations must demonstrate efficient target
progress or reach a credible near-target layout. Each checkpoint and landmark
generation has circuit breakers for incompatible probes, productive workers, visited
states, and cumulative worker time. Bridge exploration uses one execution lane and
cannot replenish indefinitely. A successful evacuation retires pending opening work
and releases active opening workers from the required portfolio; packing repeats the
release defensively. Bounded exact handoffs run only a small contour around each
checkpoint.

The board analysis is puzzle-independent. It detects articulation gates and
one-entrance rooms, derives farthest-first packing pressure and goal dependencies,
and marks high-traffic packing cells. Hard pruning includes static and player-side
dead squares, label-aware Hall deadlocks, 2x2 blocks, wall- or immovable-box-ended
closed diagonals, recursive per-box freezes, and sealed corrals. Typed goal
sequences are accepted only when at least one frozen participant remains
unfinished. Globally forced pushes in straight tunnels are collapsed into macros.
Small non-branching typed or generic-box neighborhoods additionally use a cached
relaxed pattern search. The robot may stand on every legal support square and
boxes may escape through the pattern boundary, so only a completely enumerated
pattern unsalvageable under those more generous rules is rejected. Dihedral
canonicalization shares mirror and rotation results. The reviewed deterministic
limit is 512 states, 18 floor cells, and four boxes; cutoffs and larger or
branching neighborhoods retain the state. The same proven subset runs in Python.
Heuristic room ordering affects priority only; it never rejects a state.
Boxes occupying the exterior approach to an unresolved one-entrance room add
congestion pressure, encouraging the solver to clear staging gates before packing.

Goal packing uses a conservative commitment oracle instead of rewarding every
currently matched box equally. A placement is temporary when fixing it would
block pending room dependencies, occupy a required gate, or destroy the remaining
typed perfect matching and its static or dynamic support routes. Support routes
are selected from the exact box-to-goal assignment, expanded through transitive
box prerequisites, and reject cyclic or incomplete proof chains. Movable placements
that pass those checks are conditional and receive a reduced ordering reward. A
matched box is proven when it is statically immovable or belongs to an exactly
completed one-entry room whose imports, exports, gate, staging, matching, and support
requirements are resolved. Beam, bounded DFS, and IDA* keep proven boxes fixed;
baseline search and gameplay retain ordinary legal movement. Commitment is cached by
box layout and robot region, and macros re-evaluate it after each push.

Advanced forward searches also build a bounded, dynamic support-square dependency
graph for each expanded robot region and box layout. Goal-directed push gradients
identify useful box destinations and their required robot standing squares. When a
standing square is inaccessible, a minimum-blocker route records the boxes that must
move first; candidate pushes that clear those prerequisites are ordered earlier,
while pushes that occupy demanded staging sides are ordered later. The graph is
cached and instrumented, and remains an ordering signal rather than a pruning rule.

Small gated goal rooms and genuine inaccessible corrals use a shared dense exact
push-state search. Typed box tokens, occupancy bitsets, canonical robot regions,
and disconnected static-domain components give a collision-free compact state.
Room entries include nearby staging cells and track typed imports, exports, doorway
occupancy, restored doorway states, packed goals, and viable boundaries. Corral
entries search for the shortest way to reopen access or resolve enclosed goals.
The combinatorial state upper bound guarantees a conclusive result for rooms up
to 16 cells, domains up to 24 cells, five boxes, and at most 250,000 canonical
states. Larger cases report `oversized`; unexpected cutoffs remain explicit.
Only proof-complete results are cached.

Local exhaustion becomes a global rejection only when the abstraction contains
every box and every floor edge—so no box can leave and later re-enter through an
omitted square—and imports and exports are both zero. The same closed-domain
condition lets a corral prove a movable goal box safe by solving the remaining
goals with that cell treated as a wall. Open corrals remain lower-confidence
ordering evidence. Differential tests compare every hard rejection and proven
lock with unpruned reachability, including the complete Huge replay.

Bounded one-entrance goal rooms also compile a reusable reverse packing table from
the fully packed typed-goal arrangement. Reverse-legal pushes retain the robot's
reachable-region identity, so table hits provide an exact remaining push count and
all optimal next packing pushes. Tables are limited by room, domain, box, and state
budgets; unsupported or cutoff rooms fall back to the forward local search. A missing
entry is diagnostic for the bounded doorway abstraction and is never treated as an
unconditional global deadlock, since moving farther outside the abstraction may help.

One-entrance room topology now compiles doorway lanes and nearby interior/exterior
staging sets. A cached typed-flow analysis compares each room's current labels with
its target labels, records required imports and exports, checks whether the geometry
supports each direction, measures open staging capacity and dynamically ready lanes,
and reports blocked gates or capacity contradictions. Push ordering favors the right
label moving through the gate in the required direction and discourages consuming
needed staging cells. These constraints remain diagnostic ordering pressure rather
than hard pruning.

Small searches remain exhaustive. Complex boards use explicit state and cache
budgets. After the bounded heuristic portfolio finishes, persistent push-IDA*
workers hash-partition the contour at a shallow push depth. IDA* uses an explicit
traversal stack rather than JavaScript recursion. Production proof workers yield
after bounded work slices and save a versioned, board-hashed checkpoint containing
their contour, shard, stack, and bounded recent performance cache. A compatible
checkpoint resumes after a worker restart or page reload; incompatible board,
build, bound, and shard data is rejected. **Clear Saved Search** explicitly discards
the current puzzle's durable proof state.

The union of the shards covers the contour, and an unsolvability proof is accepted
only after every shard exhausts its partition. Search continues until it finds a
solution, proves the state space unsolvable, reports a platform failure, or you
press **Stop**; there is no fixed push-depth ceiling when no learned incumbent is
available.
Required phase work is tracked separately from opportunistic landmark bridges, so
bridge churn cannot postpone exact search. When required handoffs finish, pending
and active bridges are retired and remaining browser capacity transitions to the
first-solution portfolio.

The first-solution portfolio now separates discovery from proof. Checkpoints are
ranked by accumulated pushes plus their admissible remaining estimate, while phase
diversity prevents every worker from starting at a nearly identical packing layout.
Its first worker constructs board-derived assignment, doorway-flow, staging,
packing-order, and goal-access objectives, then chains bounded single-box macros
while retaining both heuristic and structural elites.
Rotations and reflections enter this bounded lane in one canonical orientation,
with replayable paths mapped back to the displayed board. Discovery uses the
inexpensive assignment bound; proof searches retain the stronger interaction
tables.
On capable browsers, cost-aware guided beams search from the best distinct
checkpoints while one persistent exact worker continues the admissible contour.
Packing checkpoints retire active bridge work and extreme puzzles run only the two
best local exact handoffs, allowing the anytime workers to begin earlier. No stored
solution path or puzzle-specific coordinate is used.

Build `2026-07-24.39` pauses when it finds a replay-valid solution and shows its
moves, pushes, and combined total before changing the board. **Good enough**
plays the incumbent; **Keep searching** starts the improvement/proof phase from
that persisted incumbent and its tighter bound. The improvement worker receives
the complete incumbent path and re-solves overlapping sections to remove
unnecessary pushes or walking. A later improvement pauses at the same decision
boundary, so this loop continues until the user accepts. Exact BFS and A* modes
hide the redundant improvement action because their returned objective is already
optimal. The game header reports live pushes alongside time and moves.

The released Huge structural plan still produces 330 pushes / 1,306 moves after
3,752 structural states and 19,689 generated candidates. Its bounded overlapping
window pass improved that generated route to 300 pushes / 1,222 moves in 17.2
seconds and 7,683 local states on the development machine. The same generic pass
improved the independent 250-push diagnostic route to 240 pushes. These are
regression data, not universal time guarantees or optimality claims; exact search
remains the completeness fallback.

Guided beam and bounded DFS workers publish progress on both state-count and
elapsed-time intervals, so expensive states cannot make a productive worker appear
dead merely because it has not reached a large state-reporting threshold. If a
guided beam nevertheless remains silent for the full watchdog interval, the
director launches one reduced-cost recovery from the same general state. Sequence
macros and nested endgame probes are disabled, width and state count are bounded,
and a second watchdog failure is final rather than an unbounded restart loop.

Persistent exact progress reports generated successors, threshold and incumbent-bound
prunes, corral and cycle prunes, transposition hits and evictions, shard acceptance,
shard rejection, maximum depth, and the next known contour threshold. Exact progress
is sampled by state count while guided workers also send bounded elapsed-time
liveness reports. Exact transposition capacity is divided from a device-memory-aware
total budget: a lone proof shard can retain more states, while parallel shards remain
collectively bounded.

Every public run ends with one of five meanings: `solved`,
`proven-unsolvable`, `cutoff`, `cancelled`, or `failed`, plus a machine-readable
reason. Only complete exact exhaustion may report `proven-unsolvable`; finite
bounds and guided budgets report `cutoff`. Browser and Python solvers independently
replay a candidate path before exposing `solved`. Repeated exact-worker failures
resume from the last compatible proof checkpoint and stop with `failed` after a
bounded recovery count rather than looping forever.

Exact search separates commitment checks used for proven box locking from richer
child-state signals used only to order equal-bound successors. Proven locking remains
active on every expanded state. Child commitment and doorway scoring is evaluated
only for successors inside the current contour. Beam, bounded DFS, and exact IDA*
order successors using assignment progress, bottleneck prerequisites, recent
enabling pushes, doorway tasks, and restoration obligations. Per-worker and
per-profile productivity gates measure later best-estimate or solution progress,
pause optional child doorway and packing work after an unproductive window, and
periodically resample it. Exact search changes only traversal order and never gates
required proof evidence. Progress telemetry separates evaluations, skips, order
changes, useful samples, cooldowns, and each relevance signal.

Very large puzzles can still hit browser memory or storage limits before the search
space is exhausted; such a platform failure is not an unsolvability proof. Ultimate
Bidirectional uses compact parent records, caps each
bidirectional side on complex boards, bounds worker transposition and memo
tables, and automatically reduces its reverse-worker count. A priority work queue
uses capacity released by completed forward and reverse workers. While evacuation
remains active, direct searches occupy at most two lanes, preserving parallel
discovery without letting opening work crowd out the checkpoint producer. Once
evacuation succeeds, queued opening plans are retired and active opening workers
become opportunistic: they may still find a solution, but they no longer delay
required handoffs or persistent exact search. Only one landmark bridge may be
active. During the exact phase, finished bridge and anytime workers are replaced with distinct
checkpoint-guided profiles whenever eligible checkpoints remain. Each checkpoint is
attempted at most twice with rotating profiles and seeds; the persistent exact shard
is never displaced, and a slot remains idle rather than running an unbounded duplicate.
Finished workers release their frontiers before replacement work begins.
Bidirectional heaps compact to their best 40,000 states when they grow past twice
that size. A worker that produces no message for two minutes is terminated, logged,
and replaced by the next portfolio assignment so a wedged worker cannot stall the
director indefinitely.

## How to play

Push every box onto its matching goal:

- `X` boxes go on `S` goals.
- Lettered boxes such as `A` go on the matching lowercase goal, such as `a`.
- Boxes can be pushed but cannot be pulled.

Use the arrow keys, WASD, or the on-screen arrow pad to move. Press U to undo
and R to reset. The timer starts on the first legal move.

The shared conformance fixtures verify that Python, the browser worker, and the
benchmark replay engine agree on the level catalog, symbols, typed and generic
box/goal counts, ragged walls, goal semantics, mechanically legal moves, and
deadlock-pruned search successors.

## Benchmarking

The repository includes a headless benchmark harness for algorithm tuning and
AlphaEvolve-style optimization:

```powershell
node bench/benchmark.js --suite alpha --jsonl
```

Each benchmark case runs in an isolated child process, validates any returned
solution by replaying it against the puzzle rules, and emits a single scalar
`totalScore` plus per-case timing, visited states, pushes, estimates, checkpoints,
and cutoff reasons. Invalid returned paths fail the benchmark instead of earning
partial credit. Unsolved partial credit is based on replay-valid checkpoints and
a fixed harness-owned typed push-distance evaluator, not the solver's reported
estimate. The `validation` suite adds deterministic mirrored, rotated, relabeled,
premature-goal, bottleneck, staging-capacity, coupled-room, dependency-cycle, and
multi-gate cases to reduce tuning against only the built-in layouts. Bounded
generated cases carry reviewed push expectations certified by an independent
exact push search; their private seeds never enter solver payloads.
