# Sokomind Desktop

The desktop edition is a Tkinter application for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It
includes five built-in levels, custom puzzle loading, keyboard play, a
first-move timer, undo/reset, hints, and animated solver playback.
The move-history panel records every direction and marks box pushes; use Copy to
export a replayable numbered list.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Tkinter

Tkinter ships with standard Python installers on Windows and macOS. On Debian
or Ubuntu Linux, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

There are no PyPI dependencies.

## Setup

Clone the repository and enter its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Willpatpost/Sokomind.git
cd Sokomind
```

Creating a virtual environment is optional because the project has no external
packages:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

On macOS or Linux, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.

## Run the application

```powershell
python searches/gui.py
```

Controls:

- Arrow keys or WASD: move
- Backspace or U: undo
- R: reset
- Hint: show the solver's next suggested move
- Solve: animate a complete solution
- Stop: cancel the current search or animation
- Home: return to the welcome screen

The timer begins only after the first legal move.

## Command-line solver

```powershell
python searches/Sokomind.py --puzzle medium --algorithm ultimate
python searches/Sokomind.py --puzzle large --algorithm push-greedy
python searches/Sokomind.py --puzzle medium --algorithm push-beam
python searches/Sokomind.py --puzzle medium --algorithm astar
python searches/Sokomind.py --file path/to/puzzle.txt --show-steps
python searches/Sokomind.py --help
```

Recommended algorithms:

- `ultimate`: recommended mode; combines Sokoban-specific mechanics including
  a bounded push-beam opening, forced-push macros, dead-square pruning,
  2x2, conservative closed-diagonal, and mutually frozen box-group detection,
  robot-reachability
  canonicalization, exact distinct label-aware goal matching, and push-distance
  heuristics.
- `fast` / `portfolio`: older aliases for the same recommended portfolio.
- `push-greedy`: usually the quickest way to find a playable solution on big
  levels, though it may not be shortest.
- `push-beam`: bounded push-level best-first layers; this is the first phase used
  by local Ultimate Search and is also available as Push Beam in the GUI selector.
- `push-astar`: searches at the box-push level instead of every walking step.
- `astar`, `greedy`, `bfs`, `dfs`: classic step-by-step searches, mostly useful
  for comparison and small puzzles.

`ultimate` is bounded so the app stays responsive. If it cannot solve a very
large board, try `push-greedy` directly or expect to add stronger
Sokoban-specific deadlock/pattern-database logic for that level.

Every search returns a structured terminal status: `solved`,
`proven-unsolvable`, `cutoff`, `cancelled`, or `failed`, with a reason, elapsed
time, and visited-state count. Existing callers may still unpack the result as
`path, final, elapsed, visited`. A bounded Ultimate result is a `cutoff`, never a
claim that the puzzle is impossible. Candidate solutions are independently
replayed before the CLI or GUI exposes success.

The local solver uses exact polynomial assignment for every box count, including
Hall-failure detection when no distinct box-to-goal matching exists. Its bounded
layout-only heuristic cache avoids retaining complete search states, and
push-level reachability stores compact parent directions so walking paths are
reconstructed only for legal retained pushes. Globally forced push chains are
collapsed into one search edge while retaining every walking and pushing move
needed for GUI replay.
Multi-box pruning also rejects adjacent unfinished box components only when no
member has both a free destination and free support square in any direction.
This conservative rule is checked against every solvable transition in the
generated 2x3 two-box test corpus before being used by local searches.

Puzzle symbols are `O` wall, `R` robot, `X` generic box, `S` generic goal,
and spaces for floor. Other uppercase letters are dedicated boxes and their
lowercase forms are the matching goals; `O`, `R`, `S`, and `X` are reserved
and cannot be used as dedicated labels.

## Tests

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -v
```
