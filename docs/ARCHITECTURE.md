# Sokomind solver architecture

## General-purpose search rule

Sokomind's search algorithms must derive every decision from the supplied board
and current state. Solver production code must not contain a saved solution,
level-specific coordinate, level-name branch, or heuristic tuned to recognize a
particular built-in puzzle. Built-in levels are examples and regression cases,
not privileged solver inputs.

The saved Huge route is a diagnostic replay. It is useful for identifying legal
states that pruning must preserve, measuring heuristic humps along a difficult
solution, and establishing an incumbent for tests. The solver never loads that
route and must remain correct when it is absent.

## Runtime components

- `searches/Sokomind.py` contains the Python parser and search implementations.
- `src/app.js` owns browser UI state, rendering, controls, timing, and animation.
- `src/game-state.js` is the independently testable browser gameplay/rules core.
- `src/search-log.js` provides pure readable and structured telemetry formatting.
- `src/solver-director.js` owns worker portfolios, checkpoint handoffs, lifecycle
  accounting, replay validation, and exact-search transitions.
- `src/solver-worker.js` is the stable Web Worker protocol entry point. It carries
  the page's build query into each implementation module.
- The solver engine is split into focused modules loaded by the worker:
  `src/state.js` (identities), `src/memo.js` (caching), `src/metrics.js`
  (performance), `src/topology.js` (floor graph), `src/board.js` (parsing),
  `src/heuristic.js` (assignment), `src/deadlock.js` (pruning),
  `src/analysis.js` (local search), `src/push-generation.js` (neighbors).
  `src/solver-engine.js` is the barrel re-export for backward compatibility.
- `src/solver-search.js` owns browser search algorithms, reconstruction,
  resumable exact proof checkpoints, progress messages, terminal statuses, and
  result telemetry.
- `shared/sokomind-conformance.json` is the canonical built-in level catalog and
  cross-runtime rule fixture.
- `bench/` runs isolated, replay-validated search and solution checks.

Ultimate's first discovery lane is a structural plan-macro beam. It derives global
box assignments, typed doorway exports and imports, staging capacity, crossing
conflicts, packing dependencies, and access that unsolved goals still require.
Bounded single-box macros pursue those objectives while preserving separate
heuristic and structural elites. These constraints guide an incomplete discovery
lane; they do not prune the complete exact fallback.
The lane canonicalizes all rotations and reflections before bounded search and
maps paths and checkpoints back to the supplied orientation. Its discovery score
uses assignment distance without constructing proof-only interaction tables;
complete searches retain the stronger admissible interaction bound.

Browser files remain classic scripts so the dependency-free GitHub Pages build and
Web Workers need no bundler. The HTML load order supplies pure modules and policies
before the director and UI. Worker imports load the engine before search algorithms.
Node tests evaluate the engine and search module together in the same order.

Hard pruning requires independent differential evidence. A saved solution may
prove that one route is retained, but it cannot establish that a pruning rule is
safe for arbitrary puzzles; generated and exhaustive state families provide that
broader evidence.

The exact kernel is additionally compared with an independent step-state 0-1 BFS.
The gate checks optimal push counts and solvability across exhaustive tiny states
and generated generic/typed multi-box boards, with exact options, transposition
eviction, finite bounds, and shard partitions varied independently. Exact proof
checkpoints contain traversal progress; guided checkpoints never count as proof.

Hard pruning is listed in the executable `SokomindHardPruningRules` registry.
Each entry declares an independent oracle family; the differential suite combines
exhaustive 2x3 enumeration, deterministic 3x3/3x4 properties, authored strategic
structures, and structural counterexample shrinking.

Playwright serves the production `src/` scripts and worker entry in Chromium and
WebKit. Scripted workers are used only for deterministic stale/error and Ultimate
campaign events; ordinary hint and solve coverage uses the real Web Worker.
